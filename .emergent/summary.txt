The AI engineer successfully initiated the porting of the Windows-Use project to Linux-Use, targeting Linux Mint 22.2 Cinnamon. The process involved renaming the project, updating Python dependencies, and extensively refactoring Windows-specific components to their Linux equivalents. Key files like , , , and  were modified to leverage Linux APIs (X11, AT-SPI2, , ). The agent also tackled dependency installation issues and syntax errors. A significant challenge encountered was the headless environment's lack of an X11 display, preventing direct testing of GUI-dependent components, which led to a decision to document the current state. The Anthropic API key was provided for future testing.

<product_requirements>
The user requested the creation of Linux-Use, a fork of Windows-Use, for desktop automation on Linux Mint 22.2 Cinnamon. This agent should interact with the GUI, opening applications, clicking, typing, executing shell commands, and capturing UI state without traditional computer vision. The core task involves replacing Windows-specific libraries (e.g., , , PowerShell) with Linux alternatives (, , , , bash). Critical files like , , , and  require significant adaptation. The project aims to integrate as an MCP server, using LangGraph for its core agent logic. Testing infrastructure and documentation updates are also required. The user explicitly asked for full implementation, making best decisions, and provided an Anthropic API key for testing.

The application uses a monorepo-like structure within . Initially, it had a  directory which was renamed to .



-   ****: Created to store environment variables, though no specific keys were added yet for the Anthropic key (user provided it directly).
-   ****: Created as an entry point; details of its content were truncated but implies a new main application file.
-   ****: Modified to reflect the project name  and updated with Linux-specific Python dependencies like , , Name: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
Version: 12 (bookworm)
Codename: bookworm, .  was later removed due to Python version incompatibility.
-   ****: Updated to reflect the Linux-Use project and its new context.
-   ****: This file, initially Windows-specific, was largely rewritten to include Linux-specific functions for , , , and , using , , Name: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
Version: 12 (bookworm)
Codename: bookworm, , , and . It's critical for Linux desktop interaction.
-   ****: Updated with Linux-specific browser process names, avoided apps, and excluded apps relevant to Linux desktop environments like Cinnamon.
-   ****: The  enum was updated to include Linux-relevant browser names like , , , .
-   ****: Modified to remove dependencies on  and adapt  to use  instead of PowerShell.  and  were also updated to remove  dependencies, relying on .
-   ****: This file, responsible for UI element tree navigation, was created as a new Linux-specific implementation. Initially, it uses a simplified approach leveraging  for window management, with the intent to integrate AT-SPI2 more deeply later.
-   ****: The system prompt template was updated to reflect the Linux context, mentioning , , and Linux-specific tools like / and AT-SPI.
-   ****: The main agent class was updated to reflect the  name (from ). Minor syntax fixes (f-string issues) were applied.
-   ****: Created as a temporary script to test imports, bypassing X11 requirements in a headless environment, though it still encountered X11 errors.
-   ****: Created to document the current state of the Linux adaptation work.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has completed a significant portion of the initial platform adaptation from Windows to Linux. The project structure has been refactored, with the  directory renamed to , and  updated with Linux-specific dependencies. Essential system packages and Python libraries have been installed. The core  has been largely rewritten to detect Linux distribution, screen resolution, and enumerate windows using X11/AT-SPI2 tools. Configuration files (, ) have been updated for Linux browser names and excluded apps. The  has been modified to remove Windows-specific dependencies like  and use bash for shell commands. A basic  has been created, though it currently relies on  as a simplified approach, with full AT-SPI2 integration still pending. The  and  have been updated for Linux context and class naming. Multiple dependency installation issues and syntax errors in f-strings were identified and resolved. The current immediate blocker is the inability to test GUI-dependent components due to the headless container environment lacking an X11 display. A temporary  script was created to bypass this, but still failed. The current work culminated in creating  to summarize progress given the environmental limitations.
